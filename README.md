## Scroll Effects
Background images do not scroll with page, creating an effect that makes it seem like they are still.

## Navbar Buttons
The nav buttons stay at the top of the page when scrolling, done through CSS, and clicking them allows you to jump to different parts of the page. Navbar buttons also have hover effects, achieved through CSS.

## Gallery
The gallery section contains nine images that all have hover effects when moused over. Additionally, the images can be clicked to enlarge, taking the user to a slideshow that takes them through the images with short captions beneath them. The slideshow was made using JavaScript, formated through CSS. Slideshow can be exited through an 'x' on the top right, also programmed through JavaScript.
